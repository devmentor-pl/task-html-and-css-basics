# Webscope

See the live version of [Webscope](https://devmentor.pl).

The project was mainly about learning of usage of proper semantic HTML tags.
Secondly I tried to apply BEM methodology, which was game changer for writing clear, maintainable and reusable CSS code.
Thirdly I focused on keeping CSS code in different modules in order to improve readability even more.

**Main features**:

- HTML Semantic Elements
- BEM
- Separate CSS code for each section

## 💭 Conclusions for future projects

In the next project I would like to apply RWD, to make it more accessible on different type of devices.
