You don’t need any advanced setup to run the project. Simply:

# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:satoshi300/task-html-and-css-basics.git

# Open index.html in your browser
To enable live preview in development, use the VS Code Live Server extension.

🤔 Solutions Provided in the Project
1. Flexbox-based Layout
Problem: Creating a clean, responsive layout
Solution: Use of .row, .container, .cell wrappers for control

.row {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

2. Maintaining Design Consistency
Problem: Repeating layout logic without a framework
Solution: Utility-like classes with semantic naming


.row, .container, .cell {
  outline: 5px solid;
}

3. Gradient Header Background
Issue	                        Solution
Non-standard header design	    background: radial-gradient(...)
Typography consistency      	Google Fonts: Montserrat
Precise element placement   	PerfectPixel plugin

4. Example – Gradient and Button Styling
.header {
  background: radial-gradient(rgb(194, 74, 126), rgb(105, 86, 235));
}

🔁 Reusable Parts
.row – 100% width section

.container – max-width wrapper

.cell – flexible internal block

Feature and pricing cards reuse consistent structure

💭 Conclusions for Future Projects
I would like to improve:

Responsiveness for different resolutions (e.g. 1280px, 1440px)

Use semantic HTML tags more precisely

Refactor CSS into SCSS or better BEM-based naming
