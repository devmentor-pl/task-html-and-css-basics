### 2 ) Placing graphics on a round background
Making a round background and placing graphics on a transparent background inside it. It seems like a simple task, but at the beginning of the journey of learning code it was not so.

Making the table with payments was quite easy, it took me a while to find a way to make its middle one have a very nice shadow effect underneath it, made in CSS. What is the effect of specifying a given price:
