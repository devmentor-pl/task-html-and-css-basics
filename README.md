**Webpage Demo**</br></br>
This is my first webpage ever created.  
It is a project of webpage offering ready-made templates.    
It consists of six parts: *a header, fours sections and a footer.*</br>

In the project, I worked a lot with flexbox. In my opinion, this is the best tool for centering the page content.  
I also worked with .svg files which are a great way to spice up every singe page.  
What turned out to be a challenge for me was the use of __the BEM method__.</br></br>
As I am at the beginning of my IT journey, I mainly used HTML and CSS. Everything was created in VS code.</br>

I believe that this webpage structure is universal so it is possible to use it in different projects in the future.
