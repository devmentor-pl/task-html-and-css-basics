## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- BEM pattern
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While building this project I had a chance to test my HTML and CSS skills and build page to the given design. I practise Flexbox and Grid and planning media queries while writing HTML structure.

I learned how to change SVG color while using IMG tag.

```css
SVG {
    filter: invert(70%) sepia(0%) saturate(19%) hue-rotate(347deg)
      brightness(94%) contrast(104%);
  }
}
```

### Useful resources

- [CSS filter generator to convert from black to target hex color](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - It might not work very well but it gave me an idea what properties I need to change the SVG color.
