# What I've Learned:

- Acquired practical knowledge of HTML structure and CSS styling.
- Utilized various HTML tags such as `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<aside>`, etc.
- Implemented basic CSS styles, including text colorization, background, element positioning, and usage of percentage and pixel units.

# Solutions Implemented:

- Improved HTML structure by following semantic recommendations, replacing some `<div>` tags with more appropriate ones like `<header>`, `<aside>`, `<article>`, `<figure>`.

    - Example:
    ```html
    <header>
        <h1>Header</h1>
    </header>
    ```
- Implemented CSS style adjustments to tailor the page appearance to expectations.
- Properly applied HTML and CSS tags considering the semantics and functions of each section of the page.

# Key Considerations:

- Strived to use HTML tags in line with their semantic purpose to enhance the understanding of the document structure.

    - Example:
    ```html
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    ```
- Avoided excessive use of `<div>` as containers and looked for more meaningful alternatives.

    - Example:
    ```html
    <section>
        <article>
            <!-- Article content -->
        </article>
    </section>
    ```
- Ensured proper spacing and code formatting for readability and understanding of the document structure.

    - Example:
    ```css
    /* Adding space between sections */
    section {
        margin-bottom: 20px;
    }
    ```
- Regularly used browser developer tools to track errors and adjust styles.
