## 🤔 Solutions provided in the project

- Filled the background color after the website did not render full photo after rotate:
```
.header__image--tablet {
    background-color: var(--color-alfa);
    border: 20px solid white;
    transform: rotate(-6deg);
    margin-top: 3.8em;
    margin-left: 4.6em;
    width: 78%;
    height: 69%;
    border-radius: 30px;
}
```
- Learned how and when to use semantic tags
- Learned what is the BEM naming and how to use it
- Learned a lot of new CSS commands

## 💭 Conclusions for future projects

I would like to improve

#### my BEM class name:
```
.section__row--companies
.section__image--companies
.main__text--paragraph
```
etc.

#### resposible design problem

#### using semantic tags more often
